Deliverable: Compiler

The compiler is based on LLVM/Clang infrastructure using the LibTooling library.

Extend the Clang parser to recognize the directives of the programming model (task, taskwait) and their clauses.

Implement semantic analysis of the programming model inside Clang for better diagnistics support and better interaction with the parser and other parts of the compiler.

Implementation of an external tool (using LibTooling) that performs the necessary source-to-source transformations of the input source code. The output is written in a new file.

Tool features:

Generate runtime calls to create and wait on tasks.
Generate OpenCL kernels for each user defined task.
